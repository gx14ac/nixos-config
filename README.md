# My NixOS Dev Enviroment

This repository for quick setup against VMWare running in aarch64 environment.

I'm developing on VMWare now, but I'm sure I'll move to a development machine (my own desktop) in the near future.
At that time, we will explain the procedure for an easy setup using [Dotshake](https://github.com/Notch-Technologies/dotshake) and SSH.

This repository is based on [mitchellhashimoto's nixos-config](https://github.com/mitchellh/nixos-config) repository for bootstrapping.
Thank you.
